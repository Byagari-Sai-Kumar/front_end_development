In react everything is component.

components are the build blocks of the react application.

We can have compoenent inside a component called nested components.

In simple words components are the javascript functions that returns html

Components are reuseable any number of times.

There are two types of components in react

1. Stateless Functional Components

These are regular functions that take parameters (properties or props) and returns jsx like code

use functional components as much as possible over class components

Absence of this keyword

Mainly responsible for UI

Stateless/Dumb/Presentational

2. Stateful Class Components

These are ES6 classes where render menthod is must required to return the xml

More feature rich

Main their own private state or data

complex UI logic

provide life cycle methods

Stateful/Smart/Container
