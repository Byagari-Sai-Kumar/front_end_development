1. Regular components do not implement shouldComponentUpdate whereas Pure components do.

2. Regular components by default return true for shouldComponentUpdate
Pure components checks for changes between prev props and prev state and then only re-renders

3. The comparision is done on shallow comparision based
a. Primitive shallow comparision

const a = 1;
const b = 1;
const c = a;

a === b //true
a === c //true

b. non-primitve shallow comparision

const a = [1,2,3]
const b = [1,2,3]
const c = a

a === b //false
a === c //true

4. Do not mutate the state. always return the new state or object

5. It's good practice always maintain child components as pure components when working with pure components to avoid errors
