There are two stages in react
Render phase
Commit phase

1. Render phase - React starts with the root and keep going on to the leaves. Here react uses createElement() method
to convert all the jsx to javascript objects which holds all the info about each components.

2. Commit phase - Now all the js objects are inserted into the DOM.


Re-Render 
1. Re-Render phase - React starts with the root and keep going on to the leaves finding for the components which need
updating and re-rendering i.e which are using setState(), setCount(), dispatch() methods. and these components flag 
themself as NEEDED TO BE RE-RENDER 

2. Now for those specific components react will again invoke createElement() method and createElement jsx into js objects
(react elements) and stores that render output.

3. Now react compares the previous render with the new render and only the changed/affected components are sent to DOM

Commit phase
1. Only the updates are updated in the DOM
