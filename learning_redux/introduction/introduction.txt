1. Redux is a library that is predictable, state container for javascript applications.

2. It is not tied only with react.

3. Any application using javascript like angular, vue, react can use redux.

4. Redux stores and manages the application state

5. Redux stores the application state outside of the react components and passes to whichever the components
the state is required.

6. React is a UI library and Redux is the state management library.

Three core concepts of redux

1. Store - This is the place where application state is kept or stored.

2. Action - This describes the changes in the state of the application application

3. Reducer - Works together with store and action and carries out the state transition.

Three principles of redux

1. The state is stored as an object within the application.

{
    noOfCakes:10
}

2. You are not allowed to directly update the state instead we need to tell redux to update the state called as action.

{
    type:'BUY_CAKE'
}

3. Writing pure reducer functions to handle current state and action. Reducer function instead of updating the previous state
it will emit the new state.

const reducer = (currentState,action) => {
    switch(action.type){
        case 'BUY_CAKE':
            return {
                noOfCakes: currentState.noOfCakes - 1
            }
    }
}
